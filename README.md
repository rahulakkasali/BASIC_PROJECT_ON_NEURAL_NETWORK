# üß† Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks  

This project implements a **Neural Network model** to recognize handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) from the **MNIST dataset**.  
The model is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, with supporting libraries such as **NumPy** for numerical operations  
and **Seaborn/Matplotlib** for data visualization.

## üîç Project Overview  
- Implemented a **feed-forward neural network** to classify handwritten numerical digits.  
- Designed multiple **hidden layers** and tuned the number of **neurons** to understand how network depth and complexity affect accuracy.  
- Gained a mathematical and logical understanding of how **neurons combine inputs, apply weights, biases, and activation functions** to learn patterns.  
- Used **Softmax output layer** for multi-class classification (digits 0‚Äì9).  
- Visualized the dataset, training process, and results with Seaborn/Matplotlib.
